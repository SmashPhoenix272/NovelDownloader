<p style="text-align: center;"></p><p> </p><p>I was 11 years old, and... a thief.</p><p><br/>"Did you succeed?"</p><p><br/>As I was coming toward them, Max inquired with a glimmer in his eyes.</p><p><br/>At his question, I raised the corners of my mouth and proudly displayed the coin pouch.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! I knew you could do it, Berg."</p><p> </p><p>Even Flint, our fellow comrade, joined in the celebration, giving me a friendly slap on the back. </p><p> </p><p>I lightly flicked the coin pouch in my hand and checked its weight.</p><p> </p><p>It was heavy.</p><p> </p><p>With this, it seemed like we wouldn't have to struggle to make a living for a while.</p><p><br/>Our faces bloomed with huge smiles as we looked inside the pouch.</p><p><br/>This was our usual way of living.</p><p><br/>For orphans like us living in the slums, there was no other way to survive.</p><p> </p><p>I had heard rumors of an orphanage somewhere in the northern part of the city, but it had nothing to do with us.</p><p> </p><p>“Berg, look over there.”</p><p> </p><p>As we were laughing and enjoying the movement of victory, Max suddenly wiped the smile off his face and pointed somewhere.</p><p> </p><p>At the tip of his finger, three people of our age stood.</p><p> </p><p>Just like us, they were guys who lived in the slums.</p><p> </p><p>It was also our rival group.</p><p> </p><p>If there was one difference, unlike us they were wolfmen.</p><p> </p><p>Those wolfmen kids were snickering as they looked at the coin pouch in our hands.</p><p><br/>“…Ah.”</p><p> </p><p>Looking at them, Flint clicked his tongue quietly.</p><p>.<br/>There was nothing good about the fact that other people knew you had acquired something.</p><p> </p><p>It was especially true if the opponent was the same slum people.</p><p> </p><p>Just as we didn't abide by the law, the law didn't protect us either.</p><p><br/>Even if we were beaten to death somewhere, there would be no punishment for the perpetrator.</p><p><br/>The slum was a place where strength was everything.</p><p><br/>So averting my gaze from the three individuals before me, I placed a coin pouch in my arms and spoke.</p><p><br/>"Let's go."</p><p><br/>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>That day, we hid the coin pouch, and the following day we did the same.</p><p> </p><p>We couldn't predict when they might start fighting.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps, even older brothers and sisters who were taller than us might be attracted to it.</p><p> </p><p>Although there were ways to spend money all at once, it would be a wasteful approach to take.</p><p><br/>It wasn't right to give up the money that could provide us a few weeks of food and rest, fearing a fight.</p><p><br/>Of course, fighting with the wolfmen was always unpleasant.</p><p><br/>Their sharp claws and quick reflexes always made us puzzled.</p><p><br/>But in the first place, there weren't that many races that we, humans, could defeat with our fists.</p><p><br/>So Flint, Max, and I agreed to take turns spying on the rival gang.</p><p><br/>To me, it seemed like we would have to live like this until we figured out their intentions.</p><p><br/>For at least a few days, we had to be on high alert.</p><p><br/>They would surely move quickly to obtain the whole coin pouch.</p><p><br/>Just like that, the time passed and it soon became night.</p><p> </p><p>Now it was my turn to keep watch.</p><p><br/>I hid my body and looked toward the entrance of the alley where they lived.</p><p><br/>If they wanted to attack, they had to come out through that path.</p><p><br/>“...?”</p><p> </p><p>While I was watching them, an unexpected person appeared from an unexpected place.</p><p><br/>A young girl who looked two or three years younger than me was walking hesitantly from a distance.</p><p><br/>She was of the same race as me... A human.</p><p><br/>Her expression seemed to be filled with fear.</p><p><br/>But her clothes were neat, and her face was clean and spotless, without a speck of dirt on it.</p><p> </p><p>Her shiny black hair was Curly.</p><p><br/>Overall she looked... cute.</p><p> </p><p>It was clear at once that she was not a slum dweller.</p><p> </p><p>She seemed like a daughter from a well-off household in the northern part of the city who had lost her way and ended up in this slum.</p><p><br/>"Mom...? Dad...?"</p><p> </p><p>She was a girl complete opposite of me.</p><p><br/>Confused, she looked around restlessly.</p><p> </p><p>I stared at the terrified girl for a while in silence.</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh...Mom...? Are you there…?”</p><p> </p><p>After wandering around here and there for a while, that wandering girl suddenly stopped in front of the alley where the rival gang's hideout was.</p><p><br/>She slowly swallowed her saliva and began to step towards the inside of the alley.</p><p><br/>"Are you stupid?"</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, I couldn't hold back and spoke to her.</p><p><br/>“Eek!”</p><p> </p><p>Startled, she put her hand on her chest and looked at me.</p><p> </p><p>Looking at her like that, I couldn't help and said</p><p> </p><p>"It's obviously a dangerous place. Why are you going in there?"</p><p> </p><p>It was obvious that if a fragile girl like her went into a dark alley, the outcome would be terrible.</p><p><br/>On such ambitious nights, no matter what crimes occurred, people wouldn't notice. They didn't care about a person's background.</p><p><br/>In the slum, it was natural for the night to be more dangerous than the morning.</p><p><br/>"Are you lost?"</p><p> </p><p>I asked.</p><p> </p><p>There was a part of me that didn't want to see the rival gang having a good time... But honestly, there was also a part that was attracted to her.</p><p><br/>She was so beautiful that she couldn't be compared to the girls in the slum, so somehow I just wanted to help her.</p><p><br/>Maybe I felt a sense of belonging since we were both human.</p><p><br/>However, she looked at me with fear.</p><p> </p><p>Reacting like that to my kindness, I felt hurt for no reason.</p><p><br/>"...Forget it, do as you please-"</p><p><br/>Just as I was about to turn away, three Wolfmen members appeared from the alley <br/>with their yellow eyes shining.</p><p><br/>"What's this girl doing?"</p><p> </p><p>When the girl saw the three people rushing out of the alleyway, she got even more frightened and backed away, knocking her butt off.</p><p> </p><p>"...oh."</p><p> </p><p>One of the gang members stooped down and examined the fallen girl from head to toe.</p><p><br/>"Her clothes look expensive?"</p><p> </p><p>Sensing that situation had become a nuisance, I closed my eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Hah."</p><p> </p><p>They noticed my presence at the sound of a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>"Isn't it Berg?"</p><p><br/>"Were you spying on us?"</p><p> </p><p>The leader-like figure smirked and laughed. His sharp fangs were standing out.</p><p><br/>Then, he shifted his gaze to the trembling girl on the ground.</p><p><br/>“Do you know her?”</p><p> </p><p>"I do."</p><p><br/>"...I see."</p><p><br/>The girl's gaze shifted back and forth between me and the gang members.</p><p> </p><p>Instinctively, it seemed like she felt that the gang members were more dangerous.</p><p><br/>With an anxious blink, she turned her eyes towards me, as if seeking reassurance.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh... She's really pretty. Even if we just strip her clothes off and sell them, we could make money, right?"</p><p><br/>“Eugh...!”</p><p> </p><p>The girl tightly squeezed the hem of her dress and closed her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>The gang member enjoyed her reaction and said to me.</p><p><br/>“Hey, Berg.”</p><p> </p><p>"...What?."</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t take that coin pouch, so leave this human woman to us.”</p><p><br/>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>"What's wrong? Don't you already know? We were after the coin pouch."</p><p><br/>“...”</p><p> </p><p>The leader-like guy laughed and said to his gang members.</p><p><br/>"A few days ago, Auntie Michelle said she'd give us a lot of money if we bring in a decent girl."</p><p><br/>"That pr*stitute Auntie?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. We can bring her and sell her.”</p><p> </p><p>"She seems like a well-off girl. Won't there be problems?"</p><p><br/>"If she goes there to be sold, even the nobles won't find her."</p><p><br/>"Ah... Ah..."</p><p> </p><p>I didn't know if the girl understood the phrase 'selling or pr*stitute' because she seemed too innocent.</p><p> </p><p>But whether she understood the word 'sell' or not, tears soon began to flow from her eyes.</p><p><br/>Seeing her like that, I couldn't turn back anymore.</p><p><br/>It was not like I was a good person or anything.</p><p><br/>I just didn't want to become someone in the same category as the rival gang members.</p><p><br/>“What is it, Berg? You still haven't-”</p><p><br/>-Thud!</p><p> </p><p>I kicked one of the three members, knocking them over.</p><p><br/>"Ow!"</p><p> </p><p>And as I did that, I thought to myself.</p><p> </p><p>'...Now I'm going to get seriously hurt.'</p><p> </p><p>I hoped they back off after a decent fight. Or maybe Max or Flint would show up.</p><p><br/>The leader-like person glared at me with a flushed face.</p><p> </p><p>"...Hey. I said I wouldn't take the coin pouch away.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t take it anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>I boasted, showing off.</p><p><br/>Upon hearing my words, one of the opposing gang members charged at me.</p><p> </p><p>I had to fight and clash with them, even though there was nothing to gain from it.</p><p> </p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>****</strong></p><p> </p><p>“Ptoo.”</p><p> </p><p>Saliva mixed with blood splattered out of my mouth.</p><p> </p><p>After the rival gang members had coolly beaten me up, they turned and left.</p><p><br/>I was scratched, torn, and bitten all over.</p><p> </p><p>Still, because I resisted to the end, they gave up on the girl and went back.</p><p> </p><p>Should I say I was fortunate? At least one objective was accomplished.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, get up."</p><p> </p><p>I said to the girl, who was sitting huddled with her head wrapped.</p><p><br/>She was still sobbing and tears continued to stream down her face.</p><p><br/>I scratched my head while looking at her, then sat down in the same position and placed my hand on her shoulder.</p><p><br/>"Get up. I'll help you find your parents."</p><p><br/>Upon hearing my words, the girl lifted her head.</p><p><br/>Even now, her face still looked cute.</p><p> </p><p>However, upon seeing my battered face, she burst into even greater tears... Saying 'I'm sorry' and 'Thank you' over and over again.</p><p> </p><p>Where did the fear she had of me just a while ago go, and why was she acting like this now?</p><p><br/>I didn't hate this change. But, there was no way it could continue like this.</p><p><br/>I grabbed her arm and stood up.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop crying and get up. We have to go back."</p><p><br/>But the girl shook her head weakly.</p><p><br/>"My legs... I-I don't have the strength..."</p><p><br/>"Seriously... You make excuses for everything."</p><p> </p><p>Although I said those words, my desire to help her only grew stronger.</p><p> </p><p>I offered my back to her and said.</p><p><br/>"Hop on."</p><p><br/>"Sniff... Sniff..."</p><p><br/>"Hurry. Before those guys come back again."</p><p> </p><p>At those words, the girl swallowed her breath and slowly climbed onto my back.</p><p> </p><p>She tightly wrapped her small arms around my neck. A fragrance, like that of flowers in a meadow, wafted from her.</p><p> </p><p>The more I noticed it, the more ashamed I felt of the foul odor emanating from my body.</p><p><br/>It was the first time I had ever felt self-conscious about something so natural.</p><p><br/>However, as if she didn't mind my stench, she sat firmly on my back and buried her eyes in my shoulder.</p><p><br/>In her strong embrace, I felt a surge of energy in my body.</p><p> </p><p>I started walking along the familiar slum streets.</p><p><br/>After walking like that for a while, she also calms down her crying and asked me.</p><p><br/>“…Doesn’t it hurt?”</p><p> </p><p>“It hurts.”</p><p> </p><p>"Sniff..."</p><p>When I said I was in pain,  she began shedding tears again.</p><p> </p><p>Her innocence made my nose itch.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't out of mockery. It was simply astonishing to encounter someone so pure.</p><p><br/>“Why…why are you laughing?”</p><p><br/>I didn't answer her questions.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, I asked her.</p><p><br/>"How did you end up here, in this state?"</p><p> </p><p>"Huh?"</p><p><br/>"Didn't you notice while walking? The path was getting dirtier and dirtier. You should have turned back."</p><p> </p><p>Drunkards rolling around. animal carcasses. flies and bugs... There were many things that could tell anyone that it was not a safe place at all.</p><p> </p><p>But the girl didn't answer.</p><p> </p><p>“.......”</p><p> </p><p>"Forget it. What do you know?"</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps, when one was scared, they didn't even know what they were doing. It seemed like she was in that situation too.</p><p><br/>I walked like that for a while.</p><p> </p><p>'Ahhhhhh...'</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in the distance, a howl of a wolf echoed.</p><p><br/>It was quite a creepy sound to hear on an ambitious night.</p><p><br/>Then, at that moment, a strange feeling of coolness was felt through my lower back.</p><p><br/>It was also damp...</p><p> </p><p>"Hey! Did you pee?”</p><p> </p><p>Surprised, I asked, and the girl, who was quietly scanning the alley, flinched and buried her face in my shoulder again.</p><p><br/>“Ah… N-No…?”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice trembled as she answered. I could sense that she wasn't good at lying.</p><p><br/>I released her leg that I was holding momentarily in order to put her down.</p><p> </p><p>But the girl clung tightly to me.</p><p> </p><p>"N-No... I didn't... Don't... don't throw me away..."</p><p><br/>And then, she began to shed tears again.</p><p><br/>Whatever she misunderstood, she desperately clung to me.</p><p><br/>I hate crying girls.</p><p> </p><p>That was why she should be bothering me...why do I just laugh out loud?</p><p> </p><p>I didn't feel strange about the feelings I hate.</p><p> </p><p>With the thought of just washing it off, I sighed and put her on my back again.</p><p><br/>The damp sensation quickly became familiar.</p><p> </p><p>As we continued walking, the girl gradually showed curiosity toward me.</p><p><br/>She raised her head again and repeatedly moved her nose beside my face, observing my profile.</p><p><br/>When we were almost out of the slums, she began to ask.</p><p><br/>"What... What's your name?"</p><p><br/>"What is that? Talk to me in a formal way. You look younger than me at first glance."</p><p> </p><p>"B-But...? I... I'm..."</p><p><br/>"If you didn't like it, I can let you down here."</p><p><br/>"N-No! No... no, it's not like that."</p><p> </p><p>I was fascinated by how easily she was swayed, so I stopped and turned my head toward her.</p><p><br/>The sobbing girl came right next to me and made eye contact with me.</p><p><br/>The wet eyes sparkled more than ever.</p><p> </p><p>...The kids who live well were indeed so pretty.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you noble?”</p><p> </p><p>So I asked first.</p><p> </p><p>But she shook her head in surprise.</p><p><br/>"No? Ah, no?"</p><p> </p><p>She was embarrassed, but it didn't seem like she was lying.</p><p> </p><p>I continued walking.</p><p> </p><p>I thought our conversation would end there, but the girl persisted in asking.</p><p> </p><p>"So... may... May I know your name?"</p><p><br/>"Forget it, just use informal speech. It doesn't feel good to hear it anyway."</p><p> </p><p>"...Then what's your name?"</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>She was really persistent.</p><p><br/>Even though she was showing tears now, it seemed like she would endlessly shine on the bright side.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't you heard it before?”</p><p> </p><p>I replied bluntly, expressing my doubt.</p><p><br/>"When?"</p><p><br/>"When I was talking with those three people."</p><p> </p><p>Then she responded cautiously.</p><p> </p><p>"...I was afraid, so I couldn't hear it properly."</p><p> </p><p>I felt unnecessary awkwardness in saying my name.</p><p> </p><p>Since this would probably be the last time I see her, should I even bother to answer?</p><p><br/>There would probably be lingering feelings towards her for a long time to come.</p><p><br/>There was no need to add more lingering feelings.''</p><p><br/>"Forget it. Even if I tell you, we won't meet again."</p><p><br/>"....Huh?"</p><p><br/>"Why are you surprised? Are you planning to come back to the slums?"</p><p> </p><p>“.....”</p><p> </p><p>I felt the strength leaving her arms.</p><p><br/>She was truly someone whose emotions were easy to read.</p><p><br/>"But still... still tell me anyway."</p><p><br/>She was still persistent as always.</p><p><br/>In the end, I had no choice but to answer.</p><p><br/>It wasn't a secret anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“…Berg.”</p><p> </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>I carried the girl and roamed around all over the city.</p><p><br/>Until we reached a familiar street in her eyes, there was no other choice but to do this.</p><p><br/>"...Ah!"</p><p> </p><p>And after a long time, the girl who was hanging on my back let out a sigh of relief as she saw the way she had been waiting for.</p><p><br/>In response to that sound, I also put her down.</p><p> </p><p>She, too, didn't cling to me persistently, begging me not to abandon her like before.</p><p><br/>"Now you can find your way home, right?"</p><p> </p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>The girl who had come downstairs did not answer for some reason.</p><p><br/>Since she didn't give a clear response, it became unclear whether I should leave or not.</p><p><br/>"Hurry up and tell me. I have to go back now."</p><p><br/>"Ah... Well..."</p><p><br/>She fidgeted with her fingers and hesitated.</p><p><br/>Then, she whispered softly to me.</p><p> </p><p>“You… you’re hurt, so why don’t you come to my house and get treatment?”</p><p> </p><p>“Where is your house?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a short walk from here.”</p><p> </p><p>Upon hearing her words, I turned my body.</p><p><br/>If she could find her way home, then my job was done.</p><p> </p><p>"Uh...Where are you going...!"</p><p> </p><p>But the girl didn't let me go.</p><p><br/>She turned around and grabbed my wrist, then said,</p><p><br/>“W-well, then... how about... I have a doll at home, shall we play with it?”</p><p> </p><p>“…What are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>When I pointed out how ridiculous her suggestion was, she nervously started picking at her nails and said.</p><p><br/>"But... I don't want to say goodbye..."</p><p><br/>The girl, who quickly became teary-eyed, expressed her feelings.</p><p><br/>"Can't we be friends...? We're of the same kind..."</p><p><br/>"Just because we're of the same kind doesn't mean we're all can be friends."</p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>Could she grow up properly and still be like this?</p><p><br/>Was it her bright personality that allows her to be like this?</p><p><br/>I was surprised by how casually she asked me to become friends.</p><p> </p><p>To me, who lived in the slums, a friend was someone who could provide tremendous trust.</p><p><br/>If I trusted just anyone, I would get hurt badly.</p><p><br/>However, perhaps this girl's standards were different from mine.</p><p><br/>Unlike my current self, she might make such proposals with a light-hearted attitude.</p><p><br/>Maybe this was normal for her.</p><p>“...”</p><p> </p><p>She kept fidgeting and pouting like a crybaby.</p><p><br/>But giving up old habits was really difficult.</p><p> </p><p>Again, I was thinking of ways to use her calculatedly.</p><p> </p><p>I looked at her like that for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>The girl turned around with an expression as if she was about to burst into tears, as if she had resigned herself to the silent me.</p><p> </p><p>She said without even facing me.</p><p> </p><p>“…Okay, then. Thank you...Goodbye."</p><p> </p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p> </p><p>Ignoring her words, I asked her.</p><p> </p><p>At that question, the girl quickly turned her rabbit-like eyes toward me and answered.</p><p> </p><p>"S-Sien... I'm Sien."</p><p><br/>“Sien?”</p><p> </p><p>"Sien...! Just Sien."</p><p><br/>I scratched my head and casually made her a suggestion.</p><p> </p><p>“Then, come here with something to eat in three days. That way... we won't have to miss each other."</p><p><br/>Perhaps, through her, I might be able to secure a source of food.</p><p> </p><p>If this impolite suggestion didn't appeal to her, we could just go our separate ways.</p><p><br/>However, even with that impolite suggestion, Sien's expression became brighter than ever, and she showed a big smile as she said.</p><p><br/>"Yes!"</p><p><br/>That was how our relationship began.</p><p> </p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>– – – End of Chapter – – –</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"> </p><p style="text-align: left;"></p><p></p>
