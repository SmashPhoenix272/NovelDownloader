# Current Task

## Completed Tasks

1. Implemented caching functionality using SQLite in a separate `cache/novel_cache.py` module.
2. Added EPUB export with cover images and table of contents.
3. Implemented paywall detection for the Penguin Squad site.
4. Restructured the project to include a separate `cache` folder for caching-related modules.
5. Updated README.md and codebaseSummary.md to reflect recent changes.
6. Created CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE files.
7. Added .gitignore file and removed unwanted files from the repository.

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Thoroughly test the current implementation to ensure all features are working as expected.
   - Test caching functionality
   - Test EPUB export
   - Test paywall detection

2. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
   - Add try-except blocks for potential error points
   - Implement a logging system using Python's `logging` module

3. Add support for at least one more translation site.
   - Choose a new translation site to support
   - Create a new class in the `source` directory for the new site
   - Implement the required methods: `get_chapter_links` and `get_chapter_content`
   - Update `source/translation_site.py` to include the new site class

4. Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) for easier interaction with the script.
   - Use `argparse` or `click` library to implement CLI
   - Add options for specifying input URLs, output format, etc.

5. Implement feature to resume interrupted downloads.
   - Modify the download process to keep track of progress
   - Add functionality to check for partially downloaded novels and resume from the last successful chapter

6. Start working on enhancing the EPUB export functionality.
   - Improve formatting of the EPUB output
   - Add options for customizing the EPUB (e.g., font, style)

## Ongoing Tasks

- Keep the codebase clean and well-documented.
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions.
- Monitor and address any issues reported by users.

## Future Considerations

- Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability of core functions.
- Consider adding a `config.py` file for storing configuration variables.
- Explore the possibility of implementing parallel downloading of chapters to improve speed.
- Consider adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who prefer not to use the command line.

Remember to update this file as tasks are completed and new priorities emerge.
